**This homework is due Sunday February 14, 2016 at 11:59 PM. When complete, submit your code in the R Markdown file and the knitted HTML file on Canvas.**


# Background

This HW is based on Hans Rosling talks [New Insights on Poverty](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_reveals_new_insights_on_poverty?language=en) and [The Best Stats You've Ever Seen](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen). 

The assignment uses data to answer specific question about global health and economics. The data contradicts commonly held preconceived notions. For example, Hans Rosling starts his talk by asking: (paraphrased) "for each of the six pairs of countries below, which country do you think had the highest child mortality in 2015?" 

1. Sri Lanka or Turkey
2. Poland or South Korea
3. Malaysia or Russia
4. Pakistan or Vietnam
5. Thailand or South Africa

Most people get them wrong. Why is this? In part it is due to our preconceived notion that the world is divided into two groups: the
_Western world_ versus the _third world_, characterized by "long life,small family" and "short life, large family" respectively. In this homework we will use data visualization to gain insights on this topic.  


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# Enable caching to improve performance
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache=TRUE)
```

# Problem 1

The first step in our analysis is to download and organize the data. The necessary data to answer these question is available on the [gapminder](http://www.gapminder.org/data/) website. 

## Problem 1.1

We will use the following datasets:

1.     [Childhood mortality](http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=0ArfEDsV3bBwCcGhBd2NOQVZ1eWowNVpSNjl1c3lRSWc&output=csv)
2.     [Life expectancy](http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=phAwcNAVuyj2tPLxKvvnNPA&output=csv)
3.     [Fertility](http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=phAwcNAVuyj0TAlJeCEzcGQ&output=csv)
4.     [Population](http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ&output=csv)
5.     [Total GDP](http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pyj6tScZqmEfI4sLVvEQtHw&output=csv)

Create five `tbl_df` table objects, one for each of the tables provided in the above files. Hints: Use the `read_csv` function. Because these are only temporary files, give them short names.
```{r,include=FALSE}
library(readr)

# Read the files from gapminder into dataframes, with stringsAsFactors=F 
# So that strings aren't converted to factors
chld_mort <- 
  read.csv("http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=0ArfEDsV3bBwCcGhBd2NOQVZ1eWowNVpSNjl1c3lRSWc&output=csv", stringsAsFactors=F)

life_expct <- 
  read.csv("http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=phAwcNAVuyj2tPLxKvvnNPA&output=csv", stringsAsFactors=F)

fertility <- 
  read.csv("http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=phAwcNAVuyj0TAlJeCEzcGQ&output=csv", stringsAsFactors=F)

population <- 
  read.csv("http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ&output=csv", stringsAsFactors=F)

totgdp <- 
  read.csv("http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pyj6tScZqmEfI4sLVvEQtHw&output=csv", stringsAsFactors=F)
```


## Problem 1.2

 Write a function called `my_func` that takes a table as an argument and returns the column name. For each of the five tables, what is the name of the column containing the country names? Print out the tables or look at them with `View` to determine the column.

```{r}
# Define my_func such that it can be used to get and set the name of the
# specified column by column number in the dataframe

# my_func - Get function 
my_func <- function(df, colno) {
  return(names(df)[colno]) 
}

# my_func - Set function
`my_func<-` <- function(df, colno, value) {
  names(df)[colno] <- value
  df 
}
```

## Problem 1.3 

In the previous problem we noted that gapminder is inconsistent in naming their country column. Fix this by assigning a common name to this column in the various tables.

```{r}
# Use the my_func set function to set the name of the country column in all 
# tables to "country"
my_func(chld_mort, 1) <- "country"
my_func(fertility, 1) <- "country"
my_func(life_expct, 1) <- "country"
my_func(population, 1) <- "country"
my_func(totgdp, 1) <- "country"
```

## Problem 1.4 

Notice that in these tables, years are represented by columns. We want to create a tidy dataset in which each row is a unit or observation and our 5 values of interest, including the year for that unit, are in the columns. The unit here is a country/year pair and each unit gets values:

```{r, message=FALSE}
# load `tidyr` and `dplyr`
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
```
```{r}
# The final dataframe will have key will be country:year and the value columns 
# are given below
values = c("child_mortality", "fertility", "life_expectancy", "population", "total_gdp")
```

We call this the _long_ format. Use the `gather` function from the `tidyr` package to create a new table for childhood mortality using the long format. Call the new columns `year` and `child_mortality`

```{r}
# After using glimpse to look at the year columns to get the range,
# Use gather to transform child_mort to the _long_ format
# Also convert years to numeric
chld_mort <- 
  chld_mort %>% gather(key = year, value = child_mortality, X1800:X2015) %>%
  mutate_each(funs(newval = as.numeric(gsub('X', '', .))), year)
```

Now redefine the remaining tables in this way.

```{r}
# Use the same method for the remaining dataframes except population 
fertility <- 
  fertility %>% gather(key = year, value = fertility, X1800:X2015) %>%
  mutate_each(funs(newval = as.numeric(gsub('X', '', .))), year)

life_expct <- 
  life_expct %>% gather(key = year, value = life_expectancy, X1800:X2015) %>%
  mutate_each(funs(newval = as.numeric(gsub('X', '', .))), year)

totgdp <- 
  totgdp %>% gather(key = year, value = total_gdp, X1960:X2011) %>%
  mutate_each(funs(newval = as.numeric(gsub('X', '', .))), year)

# Running gather on pupulation gave the following error:
# "attributes are not identical across measure variables; they will be dropped"
# Looking at the data, we can see the number format includes commas and hence
# gets read as factors, so fix that first before converting to long format

population <- 
  population %>%
  mutate_each(funs(newval = as.numeric(gsub(',', '', as.character(.)))), X1800:X2015) %>% 
  gather(key = year, value = population, X1800:X2015) %>%
  mutate_each(funs(newval = as.numeric(gsub('X', '', .))), year)

```


## Problem 1.5

Now we want to join all these files together. Make one consolidated table containing all the columns

```{r}
# I was getting warning about coercion to character vector,  
# read.csv using "stringsAsFactors=F" removed the warnings
consolidated <- 
  full_join(chld_mort, fertility, by = c("country","year")) %>%
  full_join(life_expct, by = c("country","year"))  %>%
  full_join(population, by = c("country","year")) %>%
  full_join(totgdp, by = c("country","year"))
```

## Problem 1.6

Add a column to the consolidated table containing the continent for each country. Hint: We have created a file that maps countries to continents [here](https://github.com/datasciencelabs/data/blob/master/homework_data/continent-info.tsv). Hint: Learn to use the `left_join` function.

```{r}
# Read in the continent-info files from github directly
continents <- 
  read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasciencelabs/data/master/homework_data/continent-info.tsv", header=FALSE, sep="\t", stringsAsFactors = F)

# Set the column names since the file didn't have a header and was given
#default names
my_func(continents, 1) <- "country"
my_func(continents, 2) <- "continent"

# Left join consolidated with continents to get continent names for the countries
consolidated <- 
  left_join(consolidated, continents, by = "country")
```

# Problem 2 

Report the child mortalilty rate in 2015 for these 5 pairs:

1. Sri Lanka or Turkey
2. Poland or South Korea
3. Malaysia or Russia
4. Pakistan or Vietnam
5. Thailand or South Africa

```{r}
# Create function that takes dataframe, list of countries, year to filter 
# and data column to report 
getMyData <- function(df, countries, yearval, colname) {
  # Filter first to get the rows by country and year
  # And then select to display only country and child mortality
  df %>% 
    filter(country %in% countries & year == yearval) %>%
    select(one_of(c("country", colname))) 
}

# Now use the function to get the data
getMyData(consolidated, c("Sri Lanka", "Turkey"), 2015, "child_mortality") 
getMyData(consolidated, c("Poland", "South Korea"), 2015, "child_mortality")
getMyData(consolidated, c("Malaysia","Russia"), 2015, "child_mortality")
getMyData(consolidated, c("Pakistan","Vietnam"), 2015, "child_mortality")
getMyData(consolidated, c("Thailand","South Africa"), 2015, "child_mortality")
```

# Problem 3

To examine if in fact there was a long-life-in-a-small-family and short-life-in-a-large-family dichotomy,  we will visualize the average number of children per family (fertility) and the life expectancy for each country.

## Problem 3.1 

Use `ggplot2` to create a plot of life expectancy versus fertiltiy for 1962 for Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Americas. Use color to denote continent and point size to denote population size:

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Load the ggplot2 library
library(ggplot2)

# Create a vector of countries we are interested in
continents <- c("Africa", "Asia", "Europe", "Americas")

# Create the plot, filtering out the data we need and using
# continent to color points and population to size the points
# Note: To label, add geom_text(aes(label=country, colour = continent), size=3)

ggplot(filter(consolidated, year==1962 & continent %in% continents), 
       aes(x = life_expectancy, y = fertility)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = continent, size=population)) +
    xlab("Life Expectancy") +
    ylab("Fertility") +
    labs(title = "Life Expectancy versus Fertiltiy for 1962")

```

Do you see a dichotomy? Explain.

I didn't see anything surprising in the plot.
The plot is as expected for Europe, we see a low fertility rate(except for Albania and Kyrgyz Republic) and high life expectancy. 
Americas is also as expected with US and Canada showing lower fertility and higher life_expectancy as compared to most South American countries
African contries have a consistent trend of higher fertility rates, but lower life expectancy. Asian countries also show a trend where countries with more stable goverments and situations seem to have higher life expectancies,

## Problem 3.2

Now we will annotate the plot to show different types of countries. 

Learn about OECD and OPEC. Add a couple of columns to your consolidated tables containing a logical vector that tells if a country is OECD and OPEC respectively. It is ok to base membership on 2015.

```{r}
# Copy list of OECD countries from http://www.oecd.org/about/membersandpartners/#d.en.194378
# and read into dataframe
OECD <- 
  read.csv("oecd.txt", stringsAsFactors=F, header = FALSE)
my_func(OECD, 1) <- "country"
# Create a dataframe for OPEC countries
OPEC <- 
  data.frame(country=c("Saudi Arabia", "Iran","Iraq", "Kuwait", "Venezuela",
                       "Qatar", "Indonesia", "Libya", "United Arab Emirates",
                       "Algeria", "Nigeria", "Angola", "Ecuador"))

# Create a new column to consolidated that denotes if it is a OECD country
consolidated <-
  consolidated %>% 
    mutate(isOECD = country %in% OECD$country)

# Create a new column to consolidated that denotes if it is a OPEC country
consolidated <-
  consolidated %>% 
    mutate(isOPEC = country %in% OPEC$country)
```

### Problem 3.3

Make the same plot as in Problem 3.1, but this time use color to annotate the OECD countries and OPEC countries. For countries that are not part of these two organization annotate if they are from Africa, Asia, or the Americas.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Create a vector of types we want filtered
type_annot <- c("OECD", "OPEC", "Africa", "Asia", "Americas")

# Create a new column that says OPEC, OECD, or the continent
# Tool this route since I couldn't figure out how to specify color
# based on different column values, I tried specifying all three columns 
# to specify colour, multiple geom_points, ifelse condition in color ...
consolidated <-
  consolidated %>% 
    mutate(type = ifelse(isOECD==TRUE, "OECD", 
                         ifelse(isOPEC==TRUE, "OPEC", continent)))

# Create the plot, filtering out the data we need and using the new
# "type" column to color points and population to size the points
# European countries were also filtered out to help with clarity
# Note: To add country label, add geom_text(aes(label=country, colour = type), size=3, nudge_x=0.1, nudge_y=0.1)
consolidated %>%
  filter(year==1962 & type %in% type_annot) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = life_expectancy, y = fertility)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = type, size=population)) +
    xlab("Life Expectancy") +
    ylab("Fertility") +
    labs(title = "Life Expectancy versus Fertiltiy for 1962") +
    scale_colour_manual(values = c("violet", "red", "blue", "green", "deepskyblue"))

```

How would you describe the dichotomy?

The OECD is a unique forum where the governments of 30 democracies work together to address the economic, social and environmental challenges of globalisation.

In accordance with its Statute, the mission of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is to coordinate and unify the petroleum policies of its Member Countries and ensure the stabilization of oil markets in order to secure an efficient, economic and regular supply of petroleum to consumers, a steady income to producers and a fair return on capital for those investing in the petroleum industry

The organization have very different missions, and if taken in isolation without considering other factors, seems to suggest that focus on improving the socioeconomic factors gives a bigger boost to life expectancy than capital returns. The OECD counties seems to congregate towards higher life_expectancies (close to 70) and smaller fertility rate (except for turkey & Chile). The OPEC countries tend to have high fertility rates and the life expectancy is distributed to less that 50 on Angola and close to 65 for Qatar, Kuwait etc.

### Problem 3.4

Explore how this figure changes across time. Show us 4 figures that demonstrate how this figure changes through time.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
years <- seq(1970,2015,15)
consolidated %>%
  filter(year %in% years & type %in% type_annot) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = life_expectancy, y = fertility)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = type, size=population)) +
    facet_wrap(~year) +
    xlab("Life Expectancy") +
    ylab("Fertility") +
    labs(title = "Life Expectancy versus Fertiltiy from 1965-2015") +
    scale_colour_manual(values = c("violet", "red", "blue", "green", "deepskyblue"))

```

Would you say that the same dichotomy exists today? Explain:

Looking at the data from 1970-2015 we can see that life expectancy has improved across the board and fertility rates are trending down. We see lower fertility rates and higher life expectancies for the block of OECD countries in 2015, even for those lagging behind in 1970. OPEC countries also have made big improvements in life expectancy and we see reduced fertility rates. Nigeria and Angola are lagging a bit behind other OPEC countries in terms of life expectancy.

## Problem 3.5 (Optional)

Make an animation with the `gganimate` package.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Set up options for knitr
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.show = "animate")

# Install and Load gganimate
devtools::install_github("dgrtwo/gganimate")
library(gganimate)

theme_set(theme_bw())

# Create the plot
p <- 
  consolidated %>%
  filter(year >= 1965 & type %in% type_annot) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = life_expectancy, y = fertility, frame = year)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = type, size=population)) +
    xlab("Life Expectancy") +
    ylab("Fertility") +
    labs(title = "Life Expectancy versus Fertiltiy - ")


# Run the gg_animate function and save the gif
gg_animate(p) %>%
  gg_animate_save("animate.gif", saveGif = TRUE)


```
![title](animate.gif)

# Problem 4 
Having time as a third dimension made it somewhat difficult to see specific country trends. Let's now focus on specific countries.

## Problem 4.1
Let's compare France and its former colony Tunisia. Make a plot of fertility versus year with color denoting the country. Do the same for life expecancy. How would you compare Tunisia's improvement compared to France's in the past 60 years? Hint: use `geom_line`
 
```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Install and load "gridExtra" package to draw plots side by side
install.packages("gridExtra", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
library(gridExtra)

# Create plot for fertility vs year
p1 <- consolidated %>%
  filter(country %in% c("France", "Tunisia") ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=fertility, group=country, colour=country)) +
    geom_line() +
    geom_point() +
    xlab("Year") +
    ylab("Fertility") +
    labs(title = "Fertility Rates France vs Tunisia")

# Create plot for life_expectancy vs year
p2 <- consolidated %>%
  filter(country %in% c("France", "Tunisia") ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=life_expectancy, group=country, colour=country)) +
    geom_line() +
    geom_point() +
    xlab("Year") +
    ylab("Life Expectancy") +
    labs(title = "Life Expectancy France vs Tunisia")

# Arrange the plots side by side
grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol=2)
```

Looking at the graphs side by side, we can see that France's fertility rate dropped after 1950 by a small amount and has seen a slight uptick in the recent years. Tunisia's fertility rate has dropped drastically from over 6 in 1950 to around 2 more recently. Both countries currently have similar fertility rates,

Along with the drop in fertility rate, both countries have seen a upward trend in life expectancy, with Tunisia's rising more rapidly and reaching almost to 80. France's is just slightly higher (>80) currently.

## Problem 4.2

Do the same, but this time compare Vietnam to the OECD countries.

```{r}
# Create plot for fertility vs year
p3<- consolidated %>%
  filter(country == "Vietnam" | isOECD == TRUE) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=fertility, group=isOECD, colour=isOECD)) +
    geom_line() +
    geom_point() +
    xlab("Year") +
    ylab("Fertility") +
    labs(title = "Fertility Rates OECD vs Vietnam") +
    scale_color_discrete(name="",
                         breaks=c(TRUE, FALSE),
                         labels=c("OECD", "Vietnam"))

# Create plot for life_expectancy vs year
p4<- consolidated %>%
  filter(country == "Vietnam" | isOECD == TRUE) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=life_expectancy, group=isOECD, colour=isOECD)) +
    geom_line() +
    geom_point() +
    xlab("Year") +
    ylab("Life Expectancy") +
    labs(title = "Life Expectancy OECD vs Vietnam") +
    scale_color_discrete(name="",
                         breaks=c(TRUE, FALSE),
                         labels=c("OECD", "Vietnam"))

# Arrange the plots side by side
grid.arrange(p3, p4, ncol=2)

# Instead of seeing the OECD country in a block, use average
summary1 <- consolidated %>%
            filter(country == "Vietnam" | isOECD == TRUE) %>%
            group_by(year, isOECD) %>%
            summarize(avgFertility = mean(fertility), 
                      avgLifeExpectancy = mean(life_expectancy))

p5 <- summary1 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=avgFertility, group=isOECD, colour=isOECD)) +
    geom_line() +
    geom_point() +
    xlab("Year") +
    ylab("Fertility") +
    labs(title = "Fertility Rates OECD vs Vietnam") +
    scale_color_discrete(name="",
                         breaks=c(TRUE, FALSE),
                         labels=c("OECD", "Vietnam"))


# Create plot for life_expectancy vs year
p6 <- summary1 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=avgLifeExpectancy, group=isOECD, colour=isOECD)) +
    geom_line() +
    geom_point() +
    xlab("Year") +
    ylab("Life Expectancy") +
    labs(title = "Life Expectancy for OECD vs Vietnam") +
    scale_color_discrete(name="",
                         breaks=c(TRUE, FALSE),
                         labels=c("OECD", "Vietnam"))

# Arrange the plots side by side
grid.arrange(p5, p6, ncol=2)
```

Looking at the graphs side by side, we can see that Vietnam's fertility rate dropped a little in the early 1900s and then started rising slowly. There was a steeper increase during the Vietnam war years (1955 -1975) and then it fell steadily after the war,  Looking at the OECD countries as a block, we can see that, for those countries too, on the whole the fertility rates have been falling, but there is variation within different countries. We can also see the effect of the two world wars.

Along with the drop in fertility rate, both Vietnam and the OECD block countries have seen a upward trend in life expectancy after 1950, with Vietnam's falling a little during the Vietnam war years. Though the OECD countries on the whole have a slightly better life expectancy, Vietnam has seen a steady improvement after the Vietnam war.

# Problem 5

We are now going to examine GDP per capita per day.

## Problem 5.1

Create a smooth density estimate of the distribution of GDP per capita per day across countries in 1970. Include OECD, OPEC, Asia, Africa, and the Americas in the computation. When doing this we want to weigh countries with larger populations more. We can do this using the "weight"" argument in `geom_density`. 

```{r,warning=FALSE}

# Confirm type_annot has the country types we want
all.equal(type_annot, c("OECD", "OPEC", "Africa", "Asia","Americas"))

# Create the density plot
consolidated %>%
      filter(year == 1970 & type %in%  type_annot) %>%
      ggplot(aes(x=total_gdp/(365*population))) +
      geom_density(aes(group=type, color=type, fill=type,
                 weight=population/sum(population)), alpha=0.5) +
      xlab("GDP per Capita per Day") +
      ylab("Density") +
      labs(title = "Density plot for GPD per Capita per Day in 1970")

```

## Problem 5.2

Now do the same but show each of the five groups separately.

```{r,warning=FALSE}

# Create the density plot, use facet_grid to separate by type
consolidated %>%
      filter(year == 1970 & type %in%  type_annot) %>%
      ggplot(aes(x=total_gdp/(365*population))) +
      geom_density(aes(group=type, fill=type,
                 weight=population/sum(population))) +
      facet_grid(~type) +
      geom_density(aes(group=type, fill=type,
                 weight=population/sum(population))) +
      xlab("GDP per Capita per Day") +
      ylab("Density") +
      labs(title = "Density plots for GPD per Capita per Day in 1970")
```


## Problem 5.3

Visualize these densities for several years. Show a couple of them. Summarize how the distribution has changed through the years.

```{r,warning=FALSE}

# Plot as before, but separate by year
consolidated %>%
      filter(year %in% c(1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2008) & type %in%  type_annot) %>%
      ggplot(aes(x=total_gdp/(365*population))) +
      geom_density(aes(group=type, fill=type,
                 weight=population/sum(population)), alpha=0.5) +

Looking at the different blocks, it looks like some of the OECD countries have made the most advancements in GDP. Some of the OPEC countries made advancements in 1990s, but seem to have regressed in the years after that. Americas have seen a slight but steady advance after 1970. A number of the asian countries also have made some improvements. African countries show very little improvement. 
However, I don't know if the purchasing power parity is considered in the GDP numbers, if not, we can really compare improvements across the different blocks of countries.
